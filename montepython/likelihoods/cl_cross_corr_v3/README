montepython/likelihoods/cl_cross_corr_v3/README: this file


Files you have to modify at each run (examples of those files can be found in the cl_cross_corr_param_v3 folder:
cl_cross_corr.param: MCMC params file; cosmo and nuisance params; path to XX.ylm file defined here 
cl_cross_corr.yml: Define maps and tracers; add (Gaussian) priors to nuisance parameters; modify data set here 


Files you should not modify, unless you want to inspect the code:
montepython/data.py: implementation in MP of the CCL cosmo module
montepython/initialise.py: implementation in MP of the CCL cosmo module
montepython/ccl_class.py: CCL equivalent of the classy wrapper. Create CCL class
montepython/likelihoods/cl_cross_corr_v3/__init__.py: contains the likelihood. Import data and compute loglkl at each step
montepython/likelihoods/cl_cross_corr_v3/cl_cross_corr_v3.data: dummy file. All configuration is done in the yml file




Example of run
python montepython/MontePython.py run --conf ccl.conf -p cl_cross_corr.param -o chains/test/ -N 2

conf: use ccl instead of class (do not change it)
p: parameter file (change it)
o: output directory (it must be empty or non existing. otherwise append or error)
N: number of steps (put a very large number and check convergence from time to time)

run:
python montepython/MontePython.py run --help
for all the options

Extra dependencies:
 - sacc
 - pyccl
